# Age-and-Gender-detection

Achieved upto 95% accuracy using OpenCV's Deep Neural Network model to detect faces and predict age and gender from images, videos, or webcam feeds. It employs pre-trained models for face detection, gender classification, and age estimation. Detected faces are annotated with predicted gender (Male/Female) and age group (e.g., 25-32), with confidence scores displayed. The system supports real-time processing and saves the results for further use, making it suitable for applications in analytics, security, and personalization.
